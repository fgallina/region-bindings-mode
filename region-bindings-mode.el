;;; Commentary:

;; Minor mode providing an extra keymap which is active when the
;; region is active. You can then add custom keybindings to the region
;; keymap, e.g. you could set "k" to call the command 'kill-region'
;; when the region is active.

;; This is a pretty good way to keep the global bindings clean.

;;; Installation:

;; Add this to your .emacs:

;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/folder/containing/file")
;; (require 'region-bindings-mode)
;; (region-bindings-mode-enable)

;; Alternatively, you can install this easily via MELPA through the
;; Emacs package manager. To add MELPA to the package archives:

;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)

;;; Usage:

;; Now that region-bindings-mode has been installed and initialized
;; all you need to do is to add keys to it, here's an example:

;; (define-key region-bindings-mode-map "g" 'keyboard-quit)

;; And as you would expect that will trigger a `keyboard-quit' when
;; pressing g, but this only happens when region is active.

;; If any of the bindings you define in region-bindings-mode-map leave
;; a region active (e.g. the various marking commands in
;; multiple-cursors) then you will probably want a binding which
;; temporarily disables region-bindings-mode for the currently active
;; region, so that you can type normally once you are finished using
;; the region-only bindings.  This can be achieved via:

;; (define-key region-bindings-mode-map "q" 'region-bindings-mode-off)

;; Then after pressing "q", the per-region bindings can be easily
;; reactivated by redefining or changing the active region.

;; You can have fine grained control on the situations where this mode
;; should not be enabled, the first is using the simple
;; `region-bindings-mode-disabled-modes' variable and the other is
;; using `region-bindings-mode-disable-predicates'.  This is just a
;; list of functions that receive no args and if any of them return
;; non-nil the mode is not enabled.

;; If you want to disable the mode completely, please use
;; `region-bindings-mode-disable'.
